# client_side_captcha
This is a simple recaptcha js process that uses a random position of the clicked entry instead of a fixed position it only requires encoding and decoding and makes the backend language provide the random position numbers and the way to send the secure encrypted ajax request for validation by the backend using the provided position numbers, and unlike google captcha it's not element within iframe that can simple got by javascript and clicked it uses canvas shapes so no inpsect real not customized by iframe


#### what it do more than recaptcha v2:
the idea based on to automate this you must use AI to process image and get poistions and back to app to automate click, no javascript or fixed position app clicker, note google captcha v2 uses div for input within iframe which by eye says it can inspeacted some how and 2 document.querySelector pass it

for check how simplly pass google recpatcha v2 check powershell scrape repo it contains fixed PS clicker that takes no time to pass and easy can started with selenuim when it see the captcha, but sure this less than v3 images but same level both requires AI but this simpler for user and hard for bot, but v3 take time even for normal user and keep searching for images match keyword and tons of codes to delay the automate (only issue client and server validtion that advanced developers can pass using same request, maybe in future they create something like webstorage for python for example can only accessed by client like pyJS.getValue(myData) and returned encyrpted, and pyJS.encyrptValue() that diffrent from any other server based on key or something, can also handled when jinja2 proccssed same time set something to pyJS hidden ) instead of {{12356}} , in js will be something like pyjs.getVal(), pyjs.decypt();, pyjs.encrypt, and in python pyjs.encrypt and pyjs.decyrpt (logical right now nothing do like this)
